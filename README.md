# F-SegNet
Forgery Segmentation Network

## Project Overview
F-SegNet can be used to detect image splicing forgeries. It smartly converts an image verification problem into forgery instance segmentation problem. By combining Mask R-CNN, Error Level Analysis, Normal Map Analysis, and MoCo v2 (a self-supervised learning method), F-SegNet can effectively locate spliced instances in a forged image.
